# Veracode Container/IaC/Secrets Scanning Action
1
Veracode Container/IaC/Secrets Scanning Action runs the Veracode-CLI as an action on any GitHub pipeline

## About

The `Container/IaC/Secrets Scanning Action` is designed to be used in a CI/CD pipeline to scan a local folder, remote repository, image or archive for 3rd party library vulnerabilities, infrastrucre as code misconfigurations and stored secrets.

For more information on Pipeline Scan visit Veracode Help Center Page: https://docs.veracode.com/r/Veracode_Container_Security

## Usage

Intended usage is to add a job to your CI/CD pipeline, run the scans it and returns the results.  
A build can be failed upon findings, as well the action will automatically generate SBOM files in most popular formats for you. The formats are  cyclonedx-xml, cyclonedx-json, spdx-tag-value, spdx-json and github.  
  
If the action will run within a PR, it will automatically add a comment with all results to the PR. This is done for easy review and approval processes.

If the parameter `fail_build` is set to `true`, the action will fail the step upon findings. If set to `false`, the step will not show as failed.

The full output of the action can still be reviewed on the action run overview and on the command line output.

## Examples  
All examples follow the same strucutre.
  

The basic yml  
  
  ```yml 
  Veracode-container_iac_secrets-scan:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      name: Veracode Container/IaC/Secrets scan

      steps:
        - name: checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Veracode Container/IaC/Secrets action step
          uses: veracode/container_iac_secrets_scanning@v1.0.1
          with:
            vid: ${{ secrets.VID }}
            vkey: ${{ secrets.VKEY }}
            command: "scan" 
            type: "directory"
            source: "./"
            format: "json"
            debug: false
            fail_build: true
  ``` 
  

Only create SBOM  
  
  ```yml 
  Veracode-container_iac_secrets-scan:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      name: Veracode Container/IaC/Secrets scan

      steps:
        - name: checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Veracode Container/IaC/Secrets action step
          uses: veracode/container_iac_secrets_scanning@v1.0.1
          with:
            vid: ${{ secrets.VID }}
            vkey: ${{ secrets.VKEY }}
            command: "sbom" 
            type: "directory"
            source: "./"
            format: "cyclonedx-json"
            debug: false
            fail_build: false
  ```     
 
## Compile the action  
The action comes pre-compiled as transpiled JavaScript. If you want to fork and build it on your own you need NPM to be installed, use `ncc` to compile all node modules into a single file, so they don't need to be installed on every action run. The command to build is simply  

```sh
ncc build ./src/index.ts  
```
